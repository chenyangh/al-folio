## Hello there,

My name is Chenyang Huang, a Ph.D. student from the University of Alberta. My interests mainly lie in the field of machine laerning and its application to natural language process. Currently, I am focusing on the research of parallel generation. The goal is to efficiently capture target dependencies during training and inference.
